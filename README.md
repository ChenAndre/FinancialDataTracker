## Financial Tracker Project - Data Classification Components

Implemented automatic transaction categorization using a keyword-based classification system that maps merchant names to predefined spending categories like "Food," "Shopping," and "Transportation"
Designed flexible category mapping that supports both manual customization through Google Sheets and programmatic updates for improved accuracy over time
Integrated data preprocessing techniques using Pandas to clean, transform, and normalize financial transaction data for consistent analysis and visualization
Developed transaction data pipelines that extract financial data, apply categorization logic, perform data validation, and load results into Google Sheets for visualization and reporting
Created a hierarchical classification framework that allows for both high-level category summaries and detailed sub-category analysis of spending patterns
